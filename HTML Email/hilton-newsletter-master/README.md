# hilton-newsletter

## Initial Requirements

- We need to build 2 versions (A/B) of our client's January newsletter.
- Final wireframes, design files, and newsletter URLs below and saved [here](https://tvcgroup.wetransfer.com/downloads/2cb40cf861847db79b17647d7141d2a520191227142644/d8ab54).
- We're aiming to share the HTML file to with clients for direction implementation into their system. Context below:
  - *"We don’t have a CMS exactly, it’s home built since it ties in to several of our key systems (like VOICE). This is a little technical but basically the Club Site is an ASP.NET MVC backend and front end using standard HTML5 markup, leveraging Knockout and custom JavaScript modules for functionality and interactions. We don't use Bootstrap, but use a custom Bootstrap-inspired grid framework. The CSS is custom to reduce bloat and is fully responsive for all page widths.
  Our Admin is a custom ASP.NET MVC solution using Bootstrap and Kendo UI components (for controls like the WYSIWYG, dropdowns, and text controls).
  From a device standpoint (excluding computers), iPhones and iPads are by far the majority (>70% of users)."*

## Assumptions
- HTML email templates to be shared in a zip file
- Client's system/site doesn't seem to have any implications on the emailer as the content here would be sent inside the emails and not hosted on the website
- Fonts to be one of the following web safe fonts: Arial, Verdana, Georgia, Times New Roman, Courier

## Q&A

**Can you share what platform or system Hilton will be sending these emails out on? Will it be through them or a third party partner?**
Adobe’s marketing platform. It is not a homegrown solution.

**Fonts specifications and missing assets (brand logos, social icons) would need to be shared ASAP for us to begin. Right now, we only have the imagery for the content blocks**
Primary font > Lucida Grande. We use Lucida Grande as the primary typeface for email, with Arial coded in the CSS as a backup. Secondary font > Arial. We code Arial into the CSS as a backup for systems that don’t have Lucida Grande pre-installed. We use Lucida Grande as the primary typeface for email, with Arial coded in the CSS as a backup.

## Pending items from client
- ~~Fonts specifications~~ and missing assets (brand logos, ~~social icons~~) would need to be shared ASAP for us to begin. Right now, we only have the imagery for the content blocks.
- Footer logos still missing
